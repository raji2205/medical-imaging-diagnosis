# Medical Imaging Diagnosis

This project develops a deep learning model to diagnose diseases from medical imaging data like X-rays, MRI scans, and histopathology slides using TensorFlow and PyTorch. The model achieves a high accuracy rate, enhancing patient outcomes and reducing misdiagnosis.

## Features

- Preprocesses and augments medical imaging data.
- Builds and trains a CNN for classification tasks.
- Evaluates model performance using classification metrics.
- Deploys model on cloud platforms like AWS and Google Cloud.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow, PyTorch, OpenCV, etc.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/medical-imaging-diagnosis.git
